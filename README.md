## Description :newspaper:

This project focuses on __NLP and Machine Learning techniques__ to make a highly accurate Sentiment Analysis model, which will help us make predictions upon Twitter users opinion of a movie to recommend them similar movies (with Content Based Filtering).

## Datasets :nerd_face:

This project required **two datasets** in the development phase, which you can encounter in this [repository 'datasets' directory](https://github.com/RobertFarzan/IMDb-Recommender-System-based-on-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/tree/main/datasets). Both of them are retrieved from **Kaggle**, the first one ['movie_reviews.tsv'](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/data?select=train.tsv.zip) used to train the Sentiment Analysis model, and the second one ['movies_metadata.csv'](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv) used to make the recommendations based on movie genre.
